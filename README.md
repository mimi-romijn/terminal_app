# Dating App
Dating App takes user input and generates most compatible match based on their sexual preference, their age and their star sign.

## Statement of purpose and scope
Dating App, run from the terminal

## Features List - MVP (Minimjum Viable Porduct)
- As a user, I want to be able to get matched with someone of my sexual preference.
- As a user, I want to be able to get matched with someone within appropraite age bracket.
- As a user, I want to be able to get matched with someone of a compatible star sign to mine.

## Features List - nice to haves
- As a user, would like to choose a Covidsafe date and be matched with someone who also choose the same date.
- As a user, I would like to be given the compatibility as a percentage with potential matches accoring to our star signs.
- As a user, I would like to know that there is no one under 18 years of age and no one over 118 for legal and legitimate reasons.
- As a user, I would like there be more profiles than just hard coded ones, perhaps implement gemfaker for this.

- The app handles errors gracefully, and gives helpful error messages to the user
